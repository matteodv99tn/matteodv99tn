# Welcome
Hi, I'm Matteo Dalle Vedove.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in robotics at the University under the supervision of professors Daniele Fontanelli and Matteo Saveriano.

In 2023 I graduated in Mechatronics Engineering, curricula _Electronics and Robotics_, at the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento with the degree 110 cum laude.

I have lots of passion for programming, especially at low level in both C and C++. I'm mostly focused on numerical and robotics application.
For robotics purposes I have a good confidence with the ROS2 framework.

Programming-wise, I also know how to code in MATLAB and Python, and I also tried Rust, a language that I really like but unfortunately have no time to deep dive into.
