# Hi
Hi, I'm Matteo Dalle Vedove.

I'm currently studying [Mechatronics Engineering](https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/it/lm/mechatronics-engineering) (curricula _Electronics and Robotics_) at the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento.

I like programming and I feel quite comfortable in the C and C++ languages, mainly focused in numerical application (that is my main field of interest). I also know how to write MATLAB code and I'm currently styding Python.
