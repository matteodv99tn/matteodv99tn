Introduction
------------

The introduction is the first section of the paper and must establish existing knowledge, provide essential background information, some context and motivation for the paper's purpose.
A comon structure is

   Provide a context ``->`` state the gap or the problem extension ``->`` state the purpose of the paper.

In more detail:

- provide a **background** that establishes the base field knowledge;
- narrow on the addressed **specific topic** of the paper (starting from the general field) to guide the reader;
- explain the **gap**, telling what it is missing in the literature (that the paper will address).
  This can be done with the aid of some example by citing some other papers.
  One might not state a gap explicitly, but rely on a **extension** of some previous work;
- emphasize the **purpose** of the paper by briefly stating the main contribution and providing some remarkables results;
- finally summarize the structure of the paper.
