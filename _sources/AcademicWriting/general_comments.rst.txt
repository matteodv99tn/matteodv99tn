Tenses
------
In general the choice of the verb tense in English is determined by the time of the action.
For academic writing, in general the following rules apply:

- the **past simple** (e.g. `was`, `had`, `did`, `presented`) is used to describe actions that have already happened;
  It is used to provide results and background, to describe the work done, to cite a `single` piece of research, and a method used.
- the **present simple** (e.g. `have`, `present`, `show`) is used to describe actions that are still happening or that are generally true;
  it is generally used to comment or report results, to reference `this` paper, and citing established field knowledge;
- the **present perfect** (e.g. `have <+ verb>`) is used to describe actions that have been completed recently or have an effect on the present;
  it is used to talk about work that has (or not) been done, on research activity of `multiple` studies, and the research field in general.

Lexical load
------------
In general prefer shorter and clearer words.

We call **nominalization** the process of transforming a verb into a noun;
to make the text more readable, it is better to avoid nominalization and use the verb instead.

   decision making -> decide

Including and explaining
------------------------

Each phrase (and, in a broader sense, each paragraph) must `include` in its **theme position** some **familiar information** (provided earlier) that's used as link to `explain` some new and more important concepts: the new stuff, where we want to put more **emphasis**, must be in the **stress position**.
