# 👋 Hi, I'm Matteo Dalle Vedove.

In a nutshell:

- 👨‍🎓 PhD student of **robotics** at University of Trento under the supervision of prof. Matteo Saveriano and Daniele Fontanelli. My research focuses on **Learning from Demonstration**;
- 🤖 robotics enthusiast since childhood. Currently, I rely on my good knowledge [ROS2](https://github.com/matteodv99tn/nvim) to realise all my ideas and experiments;
- 👨‍💻 passionate `C++` developer (of course, for 🤖), and I love studying to make my code _fast_ (I really like performance). I also know some `Python` and `Matlab`. Hopefully, I will have time to learn some `rust`🤞;
- ‍💻 Linux fan (I use Arch, BTW). ⚙️ Here you may find my [dotfile](https://github.com/matteodv99tn/dotfiles) and [neovim](https://github.com/matteodv99tn/nvim) configuration!
- 🎓 MSc in Mechatronics Engineering, University of Trento.
